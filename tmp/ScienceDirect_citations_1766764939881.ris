AB  - To keep pace with the latest technological changes and advancements, predicting future technological trends and topics has become a critical approach for high-tech companies and policy-making institutions. In this paper, we proposed an explorative method that integrates link prediction and Node2Vec graph embedding to predict future technology topics using co-occurrence data from patent keywords. Specifically, this method collects and preprocesses patent datasets, constructs network graphs that depict relationships among different technology topics, and builds a supervised link prediction model based on the time series of the graph to identify future technology graphs. Furthermore, node2vec graph embedding is conducted to obtain node vector representations, and then the clustering algorithms can be improved to identify the relevant topics, which could be interpreted as future technology. A case study on blockchain is conducted to validate the feasibility and practicality of the method to demonstrate the application of the method. Through the comparison of machine learning methods, we selected the Random Forest (RF) model, which presents the highest accuracy, for our experiments. The results show that the proposed method can be used to effectively visualize potential future topics related to a specific technology. Compared to traditional methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), our method can identify more unique and differentiated technological topics, significantly reducing topic overlap. Additionally, the reported method can illustrate the internal relationships of topics through subgraphs, helping readers better understand the core concepts of each topic and vividly displaying the structure and composition of the topics. Furthermore, the proposed method can also depict potential relationships between different technology topics, which can facilitate the visualization of new directions of research and development.

AB  - The transition from automated processes to mechanisms that manifest intelligence through cognitive abilities such as memorisation, adaptability and decision-making in uncertain contexts, has marked a turning point in the field of industrial systems, particularly in the development of cyber–physical systems and digital twins. This evolution, supported by advances in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, has opened the way to a new era in which systems are able to adapt and evolve autonomously, while offering more intuitive interaction with human users. This article proposes a systematic literature review to gather and analyse current research on Cognitive Cyber–Physical Systems (CCPS), Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT), and cognitive interoperability, which are pivotal in a contemporary Cyber–Physical Enterprise (CPE). From this review, we first seek to understand how cognitive capabilities that are traditionally considered as human traits have been defined and modelled in cyber–physical systems and digital twins in the context of Industry 4.0/5.0, and what cognitive functions they implement. We explore their theoretical foundations, in particular in relation to cognitive psychology and humanities definitions and theories. Then we analyse how interoperability between cognitive systems has been considered, leading to cognitive interoperability, and we highlight the role of knowledge representation and reasoning.

AB  - The rapid advancement of internet technology has led to a surge in data transmission, making network traffic classification crucial for security and management. However, there are significant deficiencies in its efficiency for handling multi-attribute analysis and its ability to expand model knowledge, making it difficult to adapt to the ever-changing network environment and complex identification requirements. To address this issue, we proposed the SNAKE (Sustainable Network Analysis with Knowledge Exploration) system, which adopts a multi-gated mixture of experts architecture to construct a multi-functional traffic classification model. The system analyzes traffic attributes at different levels through multiple expert sub-models, providing predictions for these attributes via gating and a final Tower network. Additionally, the system achieves rapid integration with modest compute: model fusion requires only a few training rounds and a small set of additional fully connected layers. The MMoE design preserves task-specific parameters with no cross-task sharing; across eight traffic-classification tasks, the fused model’s accuracy is within 1% of the monolithic model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the SNAKE system exhibits remarkable scalability when faced with incremental challenges in diverse traffic classification tasks. Currently, we have integrated multiple models into the system, enabling it to classify a wide range of attributes, such as encapsulation usage, application types and numerous malicious behaviors. These findings indicate that SNAKE can pave the way for a sustainable and multi-functional large-scale model in the field of network traffic analysis.

AB  - Microsoft Office may be by far the most widely used suite for processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Due to its popularity, it is continuously utilised to carry out malicious campaigns. Threat actors, exploiting the platform’s dynamic features, use it to launch their attacks and penetrate millions of hosts in their campaigns. This work explores the modern landscape of malicious Microsoft Office documents, exposing the means that malware authors use. We leverage a taxonomy of the tools used to weaponise Microsoft Office documents and explore the modus operandi of malicious actors. Moreover, we generated and publicly shared a specially crafted dataset, which relies on incorporating benign and malicious documents containing many dynamic features such as VBA macros and DDE. The latter is crucial for a fair and realistic analysis, an open issue in the current state of the art. This allows us to draw safe conclusions on the malicious features and behaviour. More precisely, we extract the necessary features with an automated analysis pipeline to efficiently and accurately classify a document as benign or malicious using machine learning with an F1 score above 0.98, outperforming the current state of the art detection algorithms.

AB  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) serves as a fundamental component of knowledge-based intelligent manufacturing systems, enabling the transformation of unstructured text into structured semantic information. However, current NER approaches face challenges in handling multiple levels of entity nesting in knowledge extraction, especially with high information density embedded in short text. To address this issue, an Anchor Span-based NER (ASNER) approach is introduced, which combines token and span classification for accurate and efficient extraction of manufacturing knowledge. It utilizes a boundary match neural network based on the head and tail features of entities to generate the corresponding anchor span of potential entities, enabling precise and robust entity localization in diverse contexts. Subsequently, the approach extracts token spatial contextual features by using biaffine attention and convolutional neural networks, and assigns classification categories to the anchor span-filtered entity features. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ASNER approach.

AB  - Digital transformation rapidly changes how we live our lives in the post pandemic world. Unfortunately, digital technology is not limited to law abiding organisations and citizens. Criminal organisations and individuals are quick to identify new opportunities with new technologies, and digital transformation is dramatically changing the character of crimes, terror, and other threats. The fast emergence of new crimes is facilitated by possibilities brought by disruptive technologies such as AI, Internet of Things, drones, and cryptocurrencies that can be disastrous tools in the hands of criminals. Consequently, our society needs far better capacity to prevent and investigate criminal acts to protect organisations and citizens. This brings an urgent need to proactively reform digital forensics to significantly increase our capability to meet the strain on society brought by crimes evolving in the digital transformation era. The future of forensic science is already here, characterized by a mix of opportunities and challenges. It is essential to make it harder to effectively use digital technologies for criminal activities, while leveraging the possibilities of digital technologies by those affected, law enforcement agencies, business and organisations. As digital technologies continue to evolve, we need to stay up to date with the latest developments to effectively investigate and prosecute crimes in the digital age. There is an increased reliance on digital evidence, and the amount of heterogeneous digital evidence in criminal cases keep increasing. The forensic science techniques thus become more sophisticated and play an increasingly important role. However, the scientific area is extremely broad, and beyond the capability of most forensic science labs to keep up with the technology forefront development speed. Besides an urgent need to bring up the subject to the political arena, examples of how we can meet the challenges are discussed such as by extending our cooperation, encourage and facilitate cooperation for training and education to handle the extremely broad and rapid development, working out methods for explaining and visualising evidence for the treatment and legal values of digital evidence in prosecution, and cooperation between product developers and crime investigators for swift innovation of digital forensics tools and methodologies for quickly emerging threats. This paper will highlight specific examples where modern digital techniques are used to solve crimes in the physical world as well as crimes committed in the digital domain and discuss how “good AI” can be used to fight “evil AI” and finally touch on the sensitive balance between the increased power of the new digital forensic tools and private integrity.

AB  - What we now lump under the unitary label “artificial intelligence” is not a single technology, but a highly varied set of machine learning applications enabled and supported by a globally ubiquitous system of distributed computing. The paper introduces a 4 part conceptual framework for analyzing the structure of that system, which it labels the digital ecosystem. What we now call “AI” is then shown to be a general functionality of distributed computing. "AI” has been present in primitive forms from the origins of digital computing in the 1950s. Three short case studies show that large-scale machine learning applications have been present in the digital ecosystem ever since the rise of the Internet. and provoked the same public policy concerns that we now associate with “AI.” The governance problems of “AI” are really caused by the development of this digital ecosystem, not by LLMs or other recent applications of machine learning. The paper then examines five recent proposals to “govern AI”and maps them to the constituent elements of the digital ecosystem model. This mapping shows that real-world attempts to assert governance authority over AI capabilities requires systemic control of all four elements of the digital ecosystem: data, computing power, networks and software. “Governing AI,” in other words, means total control of distributed computing. A better alternative is to focus governance and regulation upon specific applications of machine learning. An application-specific approach to governance allows for a more decentralized, freer and more effective method of solving policy conflicts.

AB  - Context:
Vulnerability detection is critical to ensure software security, and detecting vulnerabilities in smart contract code is currently gaining massive attention. Existing deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods represent the code as a code structure graph and eliminate vulnerability-irrelevant nodes. Then, they learn vulnerability-related code features from the simplified graph for vulnerability detection. However, this simplified graph struggles to represent relatively complete structural information of code, which may affect the performance of existing vulnerability detection methods.
Objective:
In this paper, we present a novel Vulnerability Detection framework based on Critical Execution Paths (VDCEP), which aims to improve smart contract vulnerability detection.
Method:
Firstly, given a code structure graph, we deconstruct it into multiple execution paths that reflect rich structural information of code. To reduce irrelevant code information, a path selection strategy is employed to identify critical execution paths that may contain vulnerable code information. Secondly, a feature extraction module is adopted to learn feature representations of critical paths. Finally, we feed all path feature representations into a classifier for vulnerability detection. Also, the feature weights of paths are provided to measure their importance in vulnerability detection.
Results:
We evaluate VDCEP on a large dataset with four types of smart contract vulnerabilities. Results show that VDCEP outperforms 14 representative vulnerability detection methods by 5.34%–60.88% in F1-score. The ablation studies analyze the effects of our path selection strategy and feature extraction module on VDCEP. Moreover, VDCEP still outperforms ChatGPT by 34.46% in F1-score.
Conclusion:
Compared to existing vulnerability detection methods, VDCEP is more effective in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities by utilizing critical execution paths. Besides, we can provide interpretable details about vulnerability detection by analyzing the path feature weights.

AB  - There has been ever-growing use of Internet and progress within many communication channels such as social media and this escalates the need for rapid and low source demanding phishing detection mechanisms. In this very study, we propose a new deep neural model for phishing URL identification so-called GramBeddings introducing some distinguishing novelties by (1) proposing the use of n-gram embeddings, computed on the fly, requiring no pre-training stage, (2) removing the necessity of word and sub-word level information, (3) providing a smart and efficient n-gram selection pipeline, and benefiting from attention mechanism. Other than that, we share a publicly available, large-scale and novel dataset22https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~selman/grambeddings-dataset/ including 800K real-world phishing and legitimate URLs. Our scheme suggests an adjustable and automated n-gram selection and filtering mechanism along with a new neural network architecture concatenating four-channel information flow through cascading CNN, LSTM, and attention layers. With that, discriminative multi-level character patterns can be discovered without any hand-crafted operation and are enabled to contribute to prediction. As a result, the proposed system provides the following features in the problem domain: (i) real-time, end-to-end and high performance inference, (ii) language-agnostic prediction, and (iii) removal of the necessity of any third-party service or hand-crafted feature. These experiments show that our approach outperforms the other models in the literature with an accuracy of 98.27%. Moreover, the comparative study conducted with several datasets clearly verifies the superiority of our model in all tests. We also examine the robustness of our model against a real-world adversarial attack and discuss the methods of overcoming such an attack. Our codebase33The code and our supplementary material will be made available at https://www.github.com/fcdalgic/GramBeddings is shared with the community to be used for benchmarking purposes in the future.

High-voltage, megawatt-level ultra-fast charging technologies can significantly reduce charging time, offering a promising solution to alleviate range anxiety. This emerging field benefits from advancements in charger technology, site planning techniques, and energy management strategies. In this review, we comprehensively examine the distinctions between ultra-fast charging stations and conventional charging stations, highlighting the core challenges across grid integration, user experience, economic viability, and environmental sustainability. We explore the constraints, objectives, variables, and algorithms involved in site selection and capacity planning, and then discuss the impact of integrating renewable energy and energy storage, as well as demand uncertainty on system planning. We analyze the operational strategies of charging stations under deterministic, uncertain, and intelligent control paradigms. This review also presents emerging trends in multi-energy integrated charging stations, the integration of artificial intelligence techniques such as spatiotemporal modeling, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent coordination for modeling and control, and potential development roadmaps. This review aims to provide valuable insights to support the sustainable and low-carbon development of future transportation and energy systems.

AB  - It is obvious that IoT devices are widely used more and more in many areas. However, due to limited resources (e.g., memory, CPU), the security mechanisms on many IoT devices such as IP-Camera, router are low. Therefore, botnets are an emerging threat to compromise IoT devices recently. To tackle this, a novel method for IoT botnets detection plays a crucial role. In this paper, we have some contributions for IoT botnet detection: first, we present a novel high-level PSI-rooted subgraph-based feature for the detection of IoT botnets; second, we generate a limited number of features that have precise behavioral descriptions, which require smaller space and reduce processing time; third, The evaluation results show the effectiveness and robustness of PSI-rooted subgraph-based features, as with five machine classifiers consisting of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Bagging, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine, each classifier achieves more than 97% detection rate and low time-consuming. Moreover, compared to other work, our proposed method obtains better performance. Finally, we publicize all our materials on Github, which will benefit future research (e.g., IoT botnet detection approach).

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in pediatric oncology, yet its full potential faces challenges. We undertook a survey aimed at assessing the viewpoints of European pediatric oncologists delving into their perceptions and expectations regarding the potential influence of AI in their clinical workflows.
Method
We conducted a survey by means of four hypothetical scenarios using AI and the Shinners Artificial Intelligence Perception (SHAIP) tool to assess healthcare professionals' perceptions of AI in pediatric oncology. We performed multinomial logistic regression to explore associations of responses to clinical scenarios with age and SHAIP scores.
Results
We obtained 140 responses and the analysis was performed on 108. The SHAIP questionnaire mean total score was 3.29 (SD 0.93) for the professional impact, and 2.37 (SD 0.61) for preparedness. Regarding the clinical scenarios, 34.9 % of respondents would ask for a procedure for confirming their diagnosis in case of discrepancy between AI decision support and human diagnosis; 55.8 % would be concerned about the generalizability an AI decision support system in case of lack of data from certain geographic areas during algorithm training; 47.6 % would feel uncomfortable in the informed consent process for an AI intervention; 10.2 % would no longer trust AI in case of a cyberattack affecting AI support for diagnosis.
Discussion
This survey underscores the importance of AI tools in pediatric oncology that incorporate human oversight in clinical decision-making and training AI algorithms with diverse and representative data. Our findings suggest that pediatric oncologists may not be adequately prepared for the seamless integration of AI in clinical practice.

AB  - Smart Buildings (SBs) employ the latest IoT technologies to automate building operations and services with the objective of increasing operational efficiency, maximising occupant comfort, and minimising environmental impact. However, these smart devices – mostly cloud-based – can capture and share a variety of sensitive and private data about the occupants, exposing them to various privacy threats. Given the non-intrusive nature of these devices, individuals typically have little or no awareness of the data being collected about them. Even if they do and claim to care about their privacy, they fail to take the necessary steps to safeguard it due to the convenience offered by the IoT devices. This discrepancy between user attitude and actual behaviour is known as the ‘privacy paradox’. To address this tension between data privacy, consent and convenience, this paper proposes a novel solution for informed consent management in shared smart spaces. Our proposed Informed Consent Management Engine (ICME) (a) increases user awareness about the data being collected by the IoT devices in the SB environment, (b) provides fine-grained visibility into privacy conformance and compliance by these devices, and (c) enables informed and confident privacy decision-making, through digital nudging. This study provides a reference architecture for ICME that can be used to implement diverse end-user consent management solutions for smart buildings. A proof-of-concept prototype is also implemented to demonstrate how ICME works in a shared smart workplace. Our proposed solution is validated by conducting expert interviews with 15 highly experienced industry professionals and academic researchers to understand the strengths, limitations, and potential improvements of the proposed system.

AB  - Improving Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), device flexibility and lowering maintenance costs are significant problems. However, as the scale of the Intelligent Industrial Internet of Things (IIIOTs) system expands, the interactions between the rules get more sophisticated, potentially leading to rule discrepancies. The algorithm for Formal Rule Conflict Detection (FRCD) is created, and a thorough explanation of the procedure is given in this paper. Two IIIOT systems were used in experiments and the results were compared with three existing standard IIIOT rule conflict detection techniques. They include policy conflict detection systems based on Web semantics (Semantic Web-Based Policy Interaction Detection with Rules, (SPIDER)), conflict detection methods based on Users, Triggers, Environment entities, and Actuators (UTEA), and semiformal conflict detection methods (Identifying Requirements Interactions using Semiformal (IRIS)). The experimental results show that the FRCD rule conflict detection method is superior.

AB  - Disaster management is typically conducted to prevent and respond to disasters. Technological innovations certainly contribute to both, but it remains unclear how. With the rapid technological advancements over the past decade, a comprehensive understanding of the latest technological advancements and their integrated applications in detecting and mitigating the destructive impacts of disasters has emerged as a critical concern for more effective disaster management. This systematic literature review focuses on three primary phases: pre-disaster, during the disaster, and post-disaster. It examines advanced monitoring technologies and sophisticated data analyses to facilitate immediate interventions. The comprehensive disaster management framework proposed in this study evaluates various regions based on their historical disaster occurrences and assigns a specific risk index to each region, thereby enabling the assessment of the preparedness of disaster response systems according to each region's potential. Furthermore, Big Data obtained through surveillance systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) communication sensors are processed using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, enhancing computational awareness and sensitivity to changes in detection and notification patterns. By accurately delineating the input and output pathways, this framework aims to optimize supply chain management during emergencies, thereby contributing to achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Through a systematic review of 135 journal articles, this study highlights the latest technological advancements for expedited disaster detection and response and proposes a structured framework to optimize disaster management and enhance societal resilience.

The models GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, and o4-mini achieve a weighted F1 score of 0.885, surpassing prior zero-shot baselines on this dataset. Stability analysis using TARa@10 demonstrates high output consistency for GPT-4.1 (0.964) and GPT-4.1-mini (0.970), indicating their reliability for operational use. Multilingual evaluation reveals only a modest English vs. non-English performance gap for GPT-4.1 (0.031), while other models perform comparably across languages. The strongest results appear in Drugs, Gambling, and Porn (F1 > 0.9), whereas lower scores are observed in ambiguous or overlapping categories like Violence (F1 ≤ 0.76) or Crypto (F1 ≤ 0.84). A qualitative review of misclassifications suggests that some model predictions align with reasonable semantic interpretations, potentially highlighting annotation inconsistencies. This work establishes a performance baseline for GPT-based models in zero-shot classification of multilingual Dark Web content and underscores the importance of clear category definitions for effective deployment.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a transformative force across business, technology, and science, yet its comprehensive impact on innovative industries remains relatively unexplored. This study delves into the interconnectedness between AI and pivotal sectors such as cryptocurrency, blockchain, metaverse, democratized banking, and Cleantech, among others. Employing the conditional autoregressive value-at-risk (CAViaR) and time-varying parameters vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR) methods, we scrutinize daily data spanning from June 1, 2018, to October 11, 2023, encompassing 12 stock indices representing each industry. Our findings unveil a strong contagion effect from AI to other innovative sectors, with the exception of Cleantech, which appears to have decoupled from the AI surge. Notably, democratized banking and the metaverse emerge as key recipients of this contagion. Examination of tail-risk spillovers highlights AI as one of the most influential risk transmitters during market tumult, while cryptocurrency and blockchain consistently function as net risk receivers throughout the sample period. The implications of these findings are multifaceted, offering substantive insights into the risk profiles of these critical innovative sectors. Investors and regulatory bodies stand to benefit significantly from this analysis, as it illuminates potential avenues for portfolio diversification and deepens understanding of contagion mechanisms within these evolving industries.

AB  - The wide adoption of Machine Learning to solve a large set of real-life problems came with the need to collect and process large volumes of data, some of which are considered personal and sensitive, raising serious concerns about data protection. Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are often indicated as a solution to protect personal data and to achieve a general trustworthiness as required by current EU regulations on data protection and AI. However, an off-the-shelf application of PETs is insufficient to ensure a high-quality of data protection, which one needs to understand. This work systematically discusses the risks against data protection in modern Machine Learning systems taking the original perspective of the data owners, who are those who hold the various data sets, data models, or both, throughout the machine learning life cycle and considering the different Machine Learning architectures. It argues that the origin of the threats, the risks against the data, and the level of protection offered by PETs depend on the data processing phase, the role of the parties involved, and the architecture where the machine learning systems are deployed. By offering a framework in which to discuss privacy and confidentiality risks for data owners and by identifying and assessing privacy-preserving countermeasures for machine learning, this work could facilitate the discussion about compliance with EU regulations and directives. We discuss current challenges and research questions that are still unsolved in the field. In this respect, this paper provides researchers and developers working on machine learning with a comprehensive body of knowledge to let them advance in the science of data protection in machine learning field as well as in closely related fields such as Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - One of the main subfields of Machine Learning (ML) that deals with human language for intelligent applications is Natural Language Processing (NLP). One of the biggest problems NLP models encounter is adversarial assaults, which lead to inaccurate predictions. To increase an NLP model’s resilience, adversarial text must be used to examine assaults and defenses. several strategies for detecting adversarial attacks have been put forth; nonetheless, they face several obstacles, such as low attack success rates on particular datasets. Some other attack methods can already be effectively defended against by existing defensive strategies. As a result, such attackers are unable to delve further into the limitations of NLP models to guide future advancements in defense. Consequently, it is required to develop an adversarial attack strategy with a larger attack duration and better performance. Firstly, we train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the IMDB dataset, which consists of labeled movie reviews that represent positive and negative sentiments on movie reviews. The CNN model performs the sentiment classification of data. Subsequently, adversarial examples are generated from the IMDB dataset utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), a well-liked and effective method in the adversarialmachine learning domain. After that, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is developed utilizing the FGSM-generated hostile cases to identify adversarial attempts on sentiment analysis systems. The LSTM model was trained using a combination of original IMDB data and adversarial cases generated using the FGSM technique. The models are tested on various standard metrics including Accuracy, precision, F1-score, etc., and it achieve about 95.6% accuracy in detecting adversarial attacks.

AB  - Community detection has emerged during the last decade as one of the most challenging problems in network science, which has been revisited with network representation learning recently and has attracted considerable attention. Many approaches have been proposed in recent years, including the latest methods based on graph convolutional network (GCN). Here, we propose a new network representation learning method based on GCN for community detection in attributed networks without prior label information. Inspired by the message pass mechanism of GCN and the local self-organizing property of community structure, we integrate a label sampling model and GCN into an unsupervised learning framework to uncover underlying community structures by fusing topology and attribute information. The label sampling model constructs a balanced training set by structural center location and neighbor node expansion to train the GCN. The experiments on various real-world networks give a comparison view to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs more efficiently with a comparative performance over current state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.

To capture this shift, we analyze 13,942 peer-reviewed publications with Latent Dirichlet Allocation, identifying 120 distinct research topics and grouping them into nine thematic clusters. Drawing on these clusters, we propose a four-lane conceptual model of “ChatGPT-driven value creation,” which portrays the AI pipeline as a sequential, feedback-linked process of knowledge conversion: (i) emerging technologies, (ii) data engineering and algorithmic development, (iii) perception-and-compliance filtering, and (iv) domain adoption. The model reveals where generative AI currently fuels innovation, most prominently in education, healthcare, and business, and where unresolved issues persist, including ethics, security, and misinformation. It also uncovers regional differences in research priorities, signaling diverse innovation dynamics across continents. Overall, by coupling large-scale topic mapping with a theoretically grounded architecture, this study offers scholars, policymakers, and practitioners a coherent framework for harnessing ChatGPT’s potential while addressing governance demands and quality constraints. Effectively, the conceptual model provides both a diagnostic lens for research and a roadmap for responsible, knowledge-intensive deployment of generative AI.

AB  - As Linux becomes more prevalent across servers, desktops, and cloud infrastructures, ransomware groups increasingly focus on targeting Linux-based systems, particularly those running on widely deployed x86 architectures. However, research on real-time, lightweight ransomware detection for Linux systems remains limited. The existing approaches, based on file backups, trap or decoy files, and file I/O behavior monitoring, are found to be ineffective against multithreaded ransomware variants, often leading to delayed detection and false positives. In this work, we introduce LARM (Linux Anti-Ransomware Monitor), a lightweight, real-time detection tool tailored for Linux systems with x86_64 architecture. LARM employs a file trap monitoring module that operates at the kernel level using eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to detect real-time ransomware activity. LARM dynamically selects trap files for monitoring through a non-parametric clustering approach of Affinity Propagation, combined with the encryption order heuristics observed in ransomware behavior. Since sole reliance on trap file monitoring may result in false positives, LARM integrates a secondary profiling mechanism that analyzes pre-encryption ransomware activity in real-time. We evaluated LARM against 14 modern Linux ransomware families, including multithreaded versions of Avos Locker and Babuk. The evaluation results demonstrate an average detection delay of 1,240 ms and a file loss rate of 0.46%, highlighting the effectiveness of LARM in early detection and mitigation of ransomware in Linux systems.

AB  - RESTful API fuzzing is a promising method for automated vulnerability detection in Kubernetes platforms. Existing tools struggle with generating lengthy, high-semantic request sequences that can pass Kubernetes API gateway checks. To address this, we propose KubeFuzzer, a black-box fuzzing tool designed for Kubernetes RESTful APIs. KubeFuzzer utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and integrate semantic information from API specifications and response messages, guiding the generation of more effective request sequences. Our evaluation of KubeFuzzer on various Kubernetes clusters shows that it improves code coverage by 7.86% to 36.34%, increases the successful response rate by 6.7% to 83.33%, and detects 16.7% to 133.3% more bugs compared to three leading techniques. KubeFuzzer identified over 1000 service crashes, which were narrowed down to 7 unique bugs. We tested these bugs on 10 real-world Kubernetes projects, including major providers like AWS (EKS), Microsoft Azure (AKS), and Alibaba Cloud (ACK), and confirmed that these issues could trigger service crashes. We have reported and confirmed these bugs with the Kubernetes community, and they have been addressed.

AB  - Depression, the most common psychological disorder, is a major contributor to suicide. Medical research reveals that physical illnesses and personality traits significantly influence depression risk by inducing varying levels of psychological stress and emotional response. However, existing depression detection approaches face three major limitations: first, they rely solely on behavioral features while neglecting the influence of disease and personality information; second, they fail to effectively capture the spatial relationships among features across different time points; and third, conventional multimodal fusion methods struggle to fully exploit the complementary information between modalities, often resulting in redundant data. To address these issues, this paper introduces the NEUD multimodal depression dataset, which includes facial video, audio, gait, personality data, and disease data from 118 individuals. Additionally, the correlation between disease and depression severity was examined with the Kruskal–Wallis H test, while personality traits’ association with depression severity was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Finally, a multimodal depression recognition framework, TransGCL, is proposed. This framework incorporates a GCN module consisting of fully connected graphs and a trainable attenuation matrix, along with a regularization-based orthogonal tri-axis multimodal fusion approach. In addition, the framework integrates disease types and personality traits to enhance the accuracy of depression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the classification task achieved an accuracy of 74 %, while the mean absolute error for the regression task reached 4.37, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model and method. This study offers novel insights and methodologies for depression detection, providing valuable references for future research.

AB  - “Industry 4.0” stands for the fourth industrial revolution, the transition from production by computer controlled isolated machines to the concept of a smart factory, where machines, materials, and personnel are digitally connected, to actively adapt to changes in workflow. It emerges from the confluence of operational technologies (OT) and information technologies (IT), which allows for higher flexibility and manufacturing of unique custom products to suit individual customer requirements. To assure quality, embracing digital transformation of non-destructive evaluation is essential. It can be an integral part of the cyber-controlled production and asset life-cycle maintenance. These two value propositions covering the asset life cycle, require digitally controlled NDE procedures and qualitative data to support automated decision making, for most known situations. With that scenario, NDE must be considered in conjunction with other engineering disciplines. Reliability assessments become a necessary prerequisite for the use of NDE data. In addition, the approach to inspector certification and experience needs to be revised. The digital technologies that are being deployed to enhance production under industry 4.0 can very well be the enablers of digitalized NDE and their integration with the asset and its owner. Model-based definition, smart robots, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and digital twins can all be used to enhance NDE inspections to a new level of performance in quality and safety assurance. These new NDE trends are summarized under the term “NDE 4.0” to meet the needs of Industry 4.0. The present review paper is aimed at capturing recent advances in digital technologies for non-destructive inspections, examples of their use, and other aspects that must be addressed to shift the paradigm. The paper also highlights the global collaboration and current trends, with an intent to inspire industry professionals to engage with NDE 4.0 – a must for Industry 4.0.

AB  - False data injection attack (FDIA) is the main network attack type threatening power system. FDIA affect the accuracy of data by modifying the measured values of measuring equipment. When the power grid topology has not changed, the data-driven detection method has high detection accuracy. However, the power grid topology changes when faults, maintenance or adjustment in power flow distribution occur in the power system. The data-driven detection method can not capture the spatial feature changes, and the detection accuracy decreases. Considering the changes of power grid topology, a false data detection method based on graph neural network is proposed in this paper, which extracts the spatial features of power grid topology information and operation data through gated graph neural network (GGNN). To enhance node representation in this method, the attention mechanism is adopted to assign aggregation weights to neighbor nodes. This method is tested on IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems. The experimental simulation results show that compared with other data-driven detection methods, the proposed method can significantly improve the detection accuracy under the changes of power grid topology.

AB  - This paper presents the FlowTransformer framework, a novel approach for implementing transformer-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs). FlowTransformer leverages the strengths of transformer models in identifying the long-term behaviour and characteristics of networks, which are often overlooked by most existing NIDSs. By capturing these complex patterns in network traffic, FlowTransformer offers a flexible and efficient tool for researchers and practitioners in the cybersecurity community who are seeking to implement NIDSs using transformer-based models. FlowTransformer allows the direct substitution of various transformer components, including the input encoding, transformer, classification head, and the evaluation of these across any flow-based network dataset. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the FlowTransformer framework, we utilise it to provide an extensive evaluation of various common transformer architectures, such as GPT 2.0 and BERT, on three commonly used public NIDS benchmark datasets. We provide results for accuracy, model size and speed. A key finding of our evaluation is that the choice of classification head has the most significant impact on the model performance. Surprisingly, Global Average Pooling, which is commonly used in text classification, performs very poorly in the context of NIDS. In addition, we show that model size can be reduced by over 50%, and inference and training times improved, with no loss of accuracy, by making specific choices of input encoding and classification head instead of other commonly used alternatives.

AB  - In an era dominated by digital interactions, phishing campaigns have evolved to exploit not just technological vulnerabilities but also human traits. This study takes an unprecedented deep dive into large-scale phishing campaigns aimed at Meta's users, offering a dual perspective on the technical mechanics and human elements involved. Analysing data from over 25,000 victims worldwide, we highlight the nuances of these campaigns, from the intricate techniques deployed by the attackers to the sentiments and behaviours of those targeted. Unlike prior research conducted in controlled environments, this investigation capitalises on the vast, diverse, and genuine data extracted directly from active phishing campaigns, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the drivers, facilitators, and human factors. Through applying advanced computational techniques, including natural language processing and machine learning, this work unveils critical insights into the psyche of victims and the evolving tactics of modern phishers. Our analysis illustrates very poor password selection choices from the victims, with 30.27% of them picking low-complexity passwords and 58.23% reusing leaked passwords. Additionally, more than 10% exhibit strong persistence in re-victimisation by posting again to the phishing platforms of the same phishers. Finally, we reveal many correlations regarding demographics and the time periods when victims are more vulnerable during the day, as well as analyse the sentiment, emotion, and tone of text responses that they submitted, illustrating how convinced they were of the scam.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) networks has gained popularity due to their amazing and cost-effective services and one of the main areas in smart cities. The stability of these networks is based on stable and secure data transmission without any vulnerabilities present used devices. Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks have brought critical interruptions in IoT services and significantly damage the network. In DDoS attacks, attackers utilize botnets, with the capability of frequently exploiting the millions of IoT devices around the globe. After the source code of Mirai malware is loaded on GitHub, the threats are significantly increased. Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is an embedded software standard for IoT device makers to advertise device specifications, including the intended communication patterns when it connects to the network. Even though the MUD mechanism is promising exertion, still there is a need for evaluating its viability, recognize its limits, and upgrade its architecture to reduce shortcomings in its architecture as well as to increase its effectiveness. This standard neither identifies the vulnerability path before the creation of the MUD profile. Thus, it is possible to exploit an IoT device even after the MUD profile is issued to the device by manipulating the vulnerabilities in the device. By keeping in mind this situation, this paper discusses the limitations of MUD in detail and proposed a framework to identify the patch and default vulnerabilities by using blockchain method before the generation/creation of MUD profiles. The proposed framework can also mitigate open ports, DDoS attacks, and Brute force attacks. The experiment results show the identification, elimination, and sharing of vulnerability report with vendors and significantly minimized the risk of IoT device exploitation.

AB  - This study aims to assess the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models in detecting cyberbullying and evaluating its psychological impact on vulnerable groups using textual and emotional features. The models assessed include traditional classifiers—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest and deep learning models, such as MLP, CNN, RNN, and (LSTM) networks. TF-IDF for text vectorization and TextBlob for sentiment analysis were utilized. In spite of TF-IDF's shortcoming. Its simplicity enabled quick prototyping and insight results. The dataset contained 58,000 tweets, with 46,000 obtained from Kaggle and 12,000 collected via the Twitter API. Tweets were labeled into cyberbullying_type (gender, age, religion, and ethnicity) and subcategories: gender (male, female, LGBT, other), age (adult, teenager, other), religion (Muslim, Christian, Jewish, other), and ethnicity (ethical, unethical, other). Keyword-based classification was used for Subcategory assignment. The emotional score derived from text served as a proxy for measuring psychological impact. We emphasize that this study is observational and does not rely on clinical psychological evaluation. Results showed that female and LGBT users experienced the highest levels of cyberbullying among gender subcategories. Teenagers were most affected by age-based bullying. Unethical content dominated ethnicity-based attacks, and Muslims faced the highest frequency of cyberbullying and negative sentiment in religious categories. Sentiment analysis assisted in identifying emotional patterns concerning online abuse. Among models RNN and LSTM models achieved the highest accuracy (0.98), outperforming others. Among the traditional models, Random Forest performed better, while Logistic Regression was the worst performing. The inclusion of sentiment features significantly improved calssification accuracy, particularly in LSTM. A multi-output LSTM model was created to predict cyberbullying_type, sub_category and sentiment all at once, providing an end-to-end detection system. This framwork enables proactive monitoring of online harm and support timely interventions.

AB  - The global halal food industry, valued at over $1.9 trillion, faces critical challenges in ensuring transparency, traceability, and compliance with Islamic dietary laws across complex supply chains. Traditional centralized systems are vulnerable to inefficiencies, fraud, and data tampering, undermining consumer trust. This paper introduces HalalChain, a blockchain-based model designed to address these gaps through decentralized verification, automated compliance, and tamper-proof data integrity. HalalChain integrates Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus, cryptographic hashing, Merkle Trees, and IoT sensors to enforce halal-specific protocols, such as ritual slaughter validation (Bismillah Allahu Akbar invocation) and cross-contamination monitoring. Key innovations include threshold cryptography for decentralized authority consensus, smart contracts for real-time Islamic compliance checks, and privacy-preserving decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Experimental evaluations demonstrate HalalChain’s superiority over existing models (AgriFoodCredChain, AgriBlockIoT), achieving a 99.8 % tamper detection rate, transaction throughput (38 TPS), consensus times of 1.2–2.5 s, 98 % validator approval rate, and optimal compliance adherence under varying loads. The framework reduces reliance on intermediaries, automates halal certification, and enhances operational efficiency while safeguarding sensitive data. These advancements position HalalChain as a transformative solution for strengthening trust, regulatory enforcement, and ethical integrity in halal supply chains globally.

AB  - As AI technology increasingly permeates industrial applications, scenario management within the context of industrial intelligence presents a complex, multidisciplinary, and spatiotemporally coupled challenge. The integration characteristics of cyber-physical-social systems make Digital Twins (DT) a promising solution. However, constructing an effective DT model for such scenarios necessitates the incorporation of detailed industrial knowledge related to the corresponding data. Formal modeling serves as a unified cognitive approach and a robust foundation for system development. Hence, this paper focuses on the scenario management challenges within the industrial intelligence context and introduces the concept of using formal modeling languages as the foundation for DTs. We propose a model management architecture and a modeling methodology tailored for scenario-specific digital twins and provide a corresponding metamodel for the modeling approach. To validate the efficacy of our architecture and models, we analyze a multi-enterprise network collaboration scenario in remote maintenance of engineering machinery. This exploration not only demonstrates the validity of the proposed models and architecture but also offers a conceptual DT model for enhancing remote machinery maintenance.

AB  - The continuous proliferation of malware poses a formidable threat to the cyberspace landscape. Researchers have proffered a multitude of sophisticated defense mechanisms aimed at its detection and mitigation. Nevertheless, malware writers persistently pursue pioneering and innovative methods to evade detection by security software, thereby presenting an ever-evolving and dynamic threat to computer systems. Malware evasion refers to the use of certain strategies by malware to evade the detection of security software. Despite numerous surveys on malware evasion techniques, the existing surveys were fragmented and focused on specific types of evasion methods, leading to a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on malware evasion approaches. To fill this gap, this paper proposed a strategy-driven framework from the perspective of malware writers. Based on this framework, we categorize existing evasion detection techniques into transformation (alter the structural and behavioral pattern of the malware), concealment (conceal the behavior of the malware), and attack-based (engage in an attack on the detector to render it inoperable) methods and conduct a comprehensive survey of the relevant research works. In addition, we demonstrate how to integrate existing evasion strategies in the process of generating malware from the perspective of malware writers to subvert the multiple defenses of defenders. Our investigation indicates that: 1) evasion techniques such as packer and code obfuscation remain the foremost selection for attackers, no fewer than 10 off-the-shelf tools provide great assistance to them, 2) environment analysis is the primary concealment-based strategy used by the attacker (48% of the reviewed concealment-based strategy), defenders need greater efforts to counter them, 3) only 3 works discussed techniques for evasion attacks by leveraging fragilities in antivirus engines, meaning that direct attack on the detector is no longer as effective, 4) reinforcement learning algorithm serves as the most popular adversarial attack-based methods and 50% of works based on reinforcement learning are effective against real-world antivirus engines. Furthermore, this paper delves into the development trends in evasive malware and open issues for defenders. The primary objective of this survey is to furnish researchers and practitioners with a thorough comprehension of malware evasion strategies and techniques, thereby fostering the advancement of more potent and efficient approaches to detect and thwart malware.

AB  - Software vulnerabilities have always been an essential issue in cyberspace, for which many vulnerability detection techniques have been investigated. Among them, deep learning-based detection techniques have demonstrated promising detection results. However, due to the various programming patterns of developers, vulnerabilities are usually associated with the code context, such as Internet of Things (IoT) programs. Therefore, we propose a contextual embedding model to integrate three hybrid models, CLSTM, CBiLSTM (sequential structure), and CNN-BiLSTM (parallel structure), based on the code characteristics of IoT applications. To further improve the precision and robustness, we apply information augment by adding synthetic data to the real-world vulnerability data to address the severe data imbalance and facilitate neural models learning vulnerability patterns. The new method inherits the architecture of CodeBERT with multiheaded attention mechanisms and learns a richer set of vulnerable code patterns with long-range context dependencies when processing code sequence data. To assess the effectiveness of hybrid contextual embedding, we contrast the neural network models developed using the representations obtained from the three embedding methods, including CodeBERT, Word2Vec, and FastText. The experiments involve IoT applications and well-known open-source APIs. The results show that the hybrid model built based on the neural features outperforms the non-hybrid model in vulnerability detection.

AB  - PowerShell is an important tool used to automate administrative tasks. It is an open-source tool that is pre-installed on Windows machines and is accessible on many other operating systems. Administrators generally utilize PowerShell to carry out a range of typical management tasks, such as adding and deleting accounts, editing groups, and accessing hard-to-find user information. However, researchers recently found that PowerShell was used to execute various attacks. These attacks leveraged PowerShell’s vast number of properties to access privileged information, gain control of entire machines or spread over an organization. Because of the obfuscation and complex natures of these malicious scripts, detection is costly and difficult. Here, we present Malicious PowerShell Script Autodetect (MPSAutodetect), a detection model that relies on machine learning techniques to detect malicious PowerShell scripts. Our model was built with the use of stacked denoising auto-encoders (SdAs) to extract meaningful features. These valuable, easily attained features were fed to the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier. Two substantial datasets (labelled and unlabelled) were collected to train and test MPSAutodetect in supervised and semi-supervised manners. The dataset contained malicious and benign obfuscated scripts. The results showed that regardless of the features extracted from the SdA, the supervised approach resulted in better detection, with a significant 98% true-positive rate and a low 0.6% false-positive rate. Thus, the analysis of MPSAutodetect showed that the model achieves respectable performance without the hassling process of manual feature engineering.

AB  - Context:
Identifying potential vulnerable code is important to improve the security of our software systems. However, the manual detection of software vulnerabilities requires expert knowledge and is time-consuming, and must be supported by automated techniques.
Objective:
Such automated vulnerability detection techniques should achieve a high accuracy, point developers directly to the vulnerable code fragments, scale to real-world software, generalize across the boundaries of a specific software project, and require no or only moderate setup or configuration effort.
Method:
In this article, we present Vudenc (Vulnerability Detection with Deep Learning on a Natural Codebase), a deep learning-based vulnerability detection tool that automatically learns features of vulnerable code from a large and real-world Python codebase. Vudenc applies a word2vec model to identify semantically similar code tokens and to provide a vector representation. A network of long-short-term memory cells (LSTM) is then used to classify vulnerable code token sequences at a fine-grained level, highlight the specific areas in the source code that are likely to contain vulnerabilities, and provide confidence levels for its predictions.
Results:
To evaluate Vudenc, we used 1,009 vulnerability-fixing commits from different GitHub repositories that contain seven different types of vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, Command injection, XSRF, Remote code execution, Path disclosure, Open redirect) for training. In the experimental evaluation, Vudenc achieves a recall of 78%–87%, a precision of 82%–96%, and an F1 score of 80%–90%. Vudenc’s code, the datasets for the vulnerabilities, and the Python corpus for the word2vec model are available for reproduction.
Conclusions:
Our experimental results suggest that Vudenc is capable of outperforming most of its competitors in terms of vulnerably detection capabilities on real-world software. Comparable accuracy was only achieved on synthetic benchmarks, within single projects, or on a much coarser level of granularity such as entire source code files.

AB  - Cyber-enabled fraud has transformed, becoming more complex and making it harder for targets and law enforcement to detect its occurrence. This study aims to recontextualize a major manifestation of this transformation, a crime called hybrid investment fraud, colloquially known as pig butchering. Hybrid investment fraud describes a cyber-enabled fraud whereby criminals gain the trust of victims by forming connections and relationships, and then exploit this trust by using a series of confidence building and coercive measures designed to encourage victims to continuously invest in securities or commodities until they become unable or unwilling to continue to make payments or the offenders become unreachable. This study further aims to address the existing knowledge gap by focusing on understudied elements of this fraud, such victim and offender characteristics and the ways hybrid investment fraud is perpetrated. To achieve this, we conducted an in-depth analysis of more than 1,300 news articles and court documents between January 1, 2018, and November 1, 2023, to identify 59 cases of hybrid investment fraud targeting victims in the United States. This article both situates hybrid investment fraud within the broader fraud literature and conducts a comprehensive of analysis of hybrid investment fraud cases to identify the types of hybrid investment fraud committed, their impact, victim and offender demographics, and offenders’ tactics, tools, and methods of operation. The findings from this study can inform criminal justice practices and future research of this fraud.

AB  - Currently, the prevalence of Android malware remains substantial. Malicious programs increasingly use advanced obfuscation techniques, posing challenges for security professionals with enhanced disguises, a proliferation of variants, and escalating detection difficulty. Leveraging semantic features presents a promising avenue to address these challenges. Rich semantic information encapsulated within opcodes and API call graphs has been identified as crucial in distinguishing benign from malicious applications. Consequently, various Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, such as Word2vec, are employed to encode features of Dalvik opcode sequences, thereby yielding embedded representations. Given that malware developers often opt for semantically similar APIs to achieve comparable functionalities, it is posited that the opcode embeddings for such APIs should exhibit similar characteristics. However, simple NLP models that only extract statistical information are insufficient for understanding obfuscated malware's behavioral patterns, as they do not provide comprehensive semantic insights. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel, lightweight embedding model based on CodeBERT and TextCNN. This model aims for efficient and precise representation of opcode sequences. Consequently, we introduce GSEDroid, an Android malware detection framework that uses an API call graph with permission and opcode semantic features to characterize APKs. This approach converts the detection challenge into a graph classification task executed via a graph neural network algorithm. The efficacy of our method has been validated through comparative analyses with other techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our GraphSage+SAGPooling model achieved an accuracy of 99.47% and an F1-score of 99.44%, underscoring its effectiveness in Android malware detection.

KW  - Countermeasures
AB  - With the increase in cyberattacks, developing appropriate strategies to mitigate and prevent them is essential. In the literature, tools exist that either help prevent or mitigate them. Attack graphs help define mitigation strategies because they help represent and visualize the attacker’s position on a system. However, the mitigation actions are not instantiated on the attack graph. This paper proposes an approach to generate an automated attack-defense graph based on real-time monitored system alerts and an extensive and comprehensive state-of-the-art review. We propose to enrich logical attack graphs generated by a logical reasoner. The enrichment process is possible thanks to a vulnerability ontology that infers additional impacts for an exploited vulnerability. We propose a countermeasure selection approach based on graph matching to generate an optimal Incident Response (IR) playbook. We propose instantiating the generated playbook’s IR actions to get an attack-defense graph in real-time. This instantiation is done thanks to anti-correlation. The anti-correlation ensures that the countermeasures are instantiated on the appropriate attack graph nodes. Only the IR actions whose execution can be launched automatically are applied. We validate our approach using two use-case scenarios that target critical industrial infrastructures. We analyze the countermeasures instantiated on the attack graphs for the scenarios that can achieve the attack goal. We evaluated the approach concerning the security relevance of instantiated countermeasures in attack graphs for several attack paths. The countermeasures instantiated on a node are always relevant to the attacker’s action represented by this node. We also evaluate the approach regarding time performance, considering several situations for the use-case scenarios. The generation time depends on the number of vulnerabilities involved in the scenario. The generation time is on average 0.161 s when the playbook has been generated before the attack defense graph generation process.

AB  - Electric Vehicles (EVs) are among the counterpart components in sustainable transportation and its economy by reducing carbon emissions, improving air quality, and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. To this end, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies are considered the main part of EV development. Consequently, V2X technologies, including Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Vehicle-to-Building (V2B), Vehicle-to-Load (V2L), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), and Vehicle-to-Ship (V2S) enable energy and data transfer between EVs and their environment, enhancing power grid stability, supporting building energy needs, and facilitating inter-vehicle communication for more efficient and sustainable transportation systems. Based on the importance of V2X, many reviews have been conducted in recent years, highlighting their different aspects and components. However, no one has anticipated a complete overview of this technology. Therefore, this overview paper presents a complete review of EVs force/energy modeling, V2X (V2G, V2B, V2V, V2L, and V2S) technologies, human intention and machine interface, electricity market, as well as the recent Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based strategies integrated with them. Furthermore, the official standards, datasets, and financed projects related to V2X technologies are investigated. Finally, the challenges of each technology are analyzed, and future works are presented. The future of EVs promises widespread adoption driven by advancements in battery technology, enhanced charging infrastructure, and supportive V2X technologies, leading to cleaner and more efficient transportation systems that contribute to global decarbonization and net-zero emission goals.

AB  - The upsurge of prolific blogging and microblogging platforms enabled the abusers to spread negativity and threats greater than ever. Negative and hateful comments are averting users from sharing their opinion freely on social media platforms. It often breaks people’s confidence and causes extensive damage to their mental health. Hence, identifying these toxic contents and taking appropriate measures against them is crucial to preserve a safe environment on social media. Numerous state-of-the-art approaches classify the whole content as toxic or non-toxic, but they don’t distinguish the precise toxic portion from the whole content. Detecting the toxic portions is essential as it substantially aids to moderate the toxic contents through excluding the abusive parts. This paper describes our proposed approach to detect the toxic portions from text contents efficiently and accurately. We explore an ensemble of sequence labeling models including the word embedding-based Spark NLP NER (named entity recognition) deep learning model, spaCy NER model with custom toxic tags, and ALBERT NER model to identify the toxic spans. The NER-based models usually intend to capture the contextual attributes of phrases and spans that are essential for named entity recognition. As the toxic span detection task also requires us to apprehend the phrasal context for detecting toxic span, the similarity between these two tasks inspires us to exploit these NER models. Finally, we determine the final toxic spans using a prevalence-based fusion of the predictions generated by these models. The fusion strategy enables us to consolidate the diversity of these models for perceiving the phrasal context in all aspects. Experimental results achieved on the SemEval-2021 toxic spans detection dataset depict that our model meticulously captures the toxic fragment and achieves a competitive result among the other state-of-the-art methods.

To tackle this issue, a novel dataset1 containing a total of 4,112 programming tasks was created by extracting tasks from various websites. Web scraping techniques were employed to collect this dataset of programming problems systematically. Specific HTML tags were tracked to extract key elements of each issue, including the title, problem description, input/output, examples, problem class, and complexity score. Examples from the dataset are provided in the appendix to illustrate the variety and complexity of tasks included. The dataset’s effectiveness has been evaluated and benchmarked using two approaches; the first approach involved fine-tuning the FLAN-T5 small model on the dataset, while the second approach used in-context learning (ICL) with the GPT-4o mini. The performance was assessed using standard metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. The results indicated that in-context learning with GPT-4o-mini outperformed the FLAN-T5 model.

AB  - Post-penetration red team automation testing effectively addresses the pain points of traditional manual red teams, including manpower, time costs, and the high level of professional knowledge required, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of red team penetration testing. However, introducing automation technology into the red team testing domain still faces numerous technical challenges. These challenges include accurately simulating real attack environments, coordinating complex attack actions, and effectively resolving uncertainties during the attack process. These challenges remain critical issues that require urgent solutions. In this context, we propose a post-penetration-oriented automated red team penetration test modeling and planning approach. The objective of this approach is to automatically generate attack paths, coordinate attack behaviors, and adjust attack behaviors based on feedback, enabling attacks on real target networks through corresponding operations. We conducted analysis and performance testing on our solution, comparing it with other available planners. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planner in achieving automated penetration testing. Compared to other available planners, ours can generate valid attack paths more quickly and exhibits excellent performance in planning effectiveness and quality. Furthermore, our planner possesses wide applicability across various penetration testing scenarios.

AB  - The Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based healthcare systems are comprised of a large number of networked medical devices, wearables, and sensors that collect and transmit data to improve patient care. However, the enormous number of networked devices renders these systems vulnerable to assaults. To address these challenges, researchers advocated reducing execution time, leveraging cryptographic protocols to improve security and avoid assaults, and utilizing energy-efficient algorithms to minimize energy consumption during computation. Nonetheless, these systems still struggle with long execution times, assaults, excessive energy usage, and inadequate security. We present a novel whale-based attribute encryption scheme (WbAES) that empowers the transmitter and receiver to encrypt and decrypt data using asymmetric master key encryption. The proposed WbAES employs attribute-based encryption (ABE) using whale optimization algorithm behaviour, which transforms plain data to ciphertexts and adjusts the whale fitness to generate a suitable master public and secret key, ensuring security against unauthorized access and manipulation. The proposed WbAES is evaluated using patient health record (PHR) datasets collected by IoT-based sensors, and various attack scenarios are established using Python libraries to validate the suggested framework. The simulation outcomes of the proposed system are compared to cutting-edge security algorithms and achieved finest performance in terms of reduced 11 s of execution time for 20 sensors, 0.121 mJ of energy consumption, 850 Kbps of throughput, 99.85 % of accuracy, and 0.19 ms of computational cost.

AB  - With the rising of Internet in early ’90s, many fraudulent activities have migrated from physical to digital: one of them is phishing. Phishing is a deceptive practice focused on exploiting the human factor, which is the most vulnerable aspect of any security process. In this scam, social engineering techniques are extensively utilized, specifically focusing on the principles of persuasion, to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information or engaging in malicious actions. This research explores the use of message subjectivity for detecting phishing attacks. It does so by assessing the impact of various data representations and classifiers on automatically identifying principles of persuasion. Furthermore, it investigates how these detected principles of persuasion can be leveraged for identifying phishing attacks. The experiments conducted revealed that there is no universal solution for data representation and classifier selection to effectively detect all principles of persuasion. Instead, a tailored combination of data representation and classifiers is required for detecting each principle. The Machine Learning models created automatically detect principles of persuasion with confidence levels ranging from 0.7306 to 0.8191 for AUC-ROC. Next, principles of persuasion detected are used for phishing detection. This study also emphasizes the need for user-friendly and comprehensible models. To validate the proposal presented, several families of classifiers were tested, but among all of them, tree-based models (and Random Forest in particular) stand out as preferred option. These models achieve similar level of effectiveness as alternative methods while offering improved clarity and user-friendliness, with an AUC-ROC of 0.859842.

AB  - Microservices architecture (MSA) is widely used by enterprises and related practitioners. Due to the importance of MSA in the industry, failure to identify its potential faults and errors will cause serious consequences. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct testing on the MSA to guarantee its quality and reliability. As a key task in the software development lifecycle, microservices testing can effectively identify defects and errors caused by incorrect or unexpected behavior of microservices software, ensuring the quality of microservices software. Currently, related reviews lack a comprehensive summary of the challenges and solutions faced by microservices testing. To fill this gap, this study provides a comprehensive review of the microservices testing. It analyzes 93 primary studies from 19595 pieces of research, eventually identifying nine categories of microservices testing methods, four types of challenges, and 5 specific solutions to challenges. The conclusion shows that the current part of microservices testing methods is significantly different from other architectural testing methods, lacking exploration of testing methods under different communication mechanisms. Furthermore, this paper discusses the above conclusions, providing directions to further narrow the gap in solutions to challenges and future development directions for microservices testing.

AB  - In today’s cybersecurity landscape, software security companies encounter a significant challenge in detecting new and unknown malware. Despite the introduction of various machine learning and deep learning tools designed to identify malicious software based on static and dynamic features, achieving the desired level of accuracy remains elusive. This challenge is exacerbated by factors such as encryption, packing, limited distribution, and uneven allocation of malware samples across different families. Moreover, deep learning techniques demand substantial time, computational resources (specifically GPUs), and expertise from data scientists for practical malware analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel GPU-free approach called Image-based Malware Classification using Broad Learning (IMCBL) to address these issues. Our method integrates visualization, feature decomposition, and broad learning architecture to enhance malware detection and classification. We convert raw malware binaries into images, reducing the necessity for extensive feature engineering. These images transform using truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the feature vector size, expediting the training process while mitigating model overfitting. The transformed feature vector is then input into our proposed Broad Learning (BL) system, which facilitates malware detection and classification. The BL architecture, structured as a flat network mapping original inputs to feature nodes and expanding the structure in enhancement nodes, ensures efficient and effective classification without the need for retraining. This dynamic and incremental learning capability sets IMCBL apart, making it superior to existing deep learning architectures. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using five benchmark malware datasets, including the Microsoft Windows malware challenge dataset, the Malimg Windows malware dataset, the IoT-Android mobile malware dataset, the Big Windows malware dataset, and an obfuscated Windows malware dataset. The results demonstrate IMCBL’s remarkable success in classifying most malware samples, even under obfuscation attacks, performing comparably or outperforming current methods using similar benchmarks. Specifically, IMCBL achieved 95.58% accuracy for the Microsoft Windows malware dataset, 97.64% accuracy for the Malimg Windows malware dataset, 96.51% accuracy for IoT Android malware datasets, and 96.19% accuracy for the extensive Windows malware dataset. Additionally, IMCBL demonstrated 93.04% accuracy for an obfuscated Windows malware dataset, which contains both packed and unpacked malware samples. Notably, IMCBL exhibits an exponential advantage in computation overhead, including training and prediction time, when compared to traditional machine learning and advanced state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3.

AB  - Cyberbullying detection remains a significant challenge in the context of expanding internet and social media usage. This study proposes a novel pretraining methodology for transformer models, integrating Part-of-Speech (POS) information with a unique way of tokenization. The proposed model, based on the ELECTRA architecture, undergoes pretraining and fine-tuning and is referred to as ELECTRA_POS. By leveraging linguistic structures, this approach improves understanding of context and subtle meaning in the text. Through evaluation using the GLUE benchmark and a dedicated cyberbullying detection dataset, ELECTRA_POS consistently delivers enhanced performance compared to conventional transformer models. Key contributions include the introduction of POS-token fusion techniques and their application to improve cyberbullying detection, as well as insights into how linguistic features influence transformer-based models. The result highlights how integrating POS information into the transformer model improves the detection of harmful online behavior while benefiting other natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in workplace settings significantly affects employees, particularly their wellbeing. Despite its growing relevance, the impact of AI on employee wellbeing remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a survey and employed structural equation modeling to analyze data from Finnish and international companies headquartered in Finland (n = 207). We found that AI adoption does not directly impact employee wellbeing but indirectly influences it through work-related factors of task optimization and safety. This highlights the importance of strategically implementing AI to enhance aspects of work that are important to employees, thereby maximizing the wellbeing benefits of AI adoption. Practically, this study underscores the need for AI adoption to result in tangible improvements in organizational tasks and processes, data security, and occupational health. When these aspects are adequately addressed, AI adoption can enhance employee wellbeing and contribute to improved human-AI integration in the workplace.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in soybean research has revolutionized various crop improvement and production aspects. This review provides predominant areas that have seen the use of AI. AI applications in phenomics have enabled collecting and analyzing high-dimensional data in soybean plants, from below- to above-ground traits, predicting phenotypes, and identifying complex patterns. In genomics, AI has improved genomic selection accuracy and identified genomic regions associated with traits of interest, such as resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. AI has also been extensively used in detecting and managing biotic and abiotic plant stresses using RGB, multispectral, and thermal imagery from ground-based and aerial platforms. Additionally, AI has shown significant potential in yield prediction, incorporating factors such as vegetation indices, weather data, and soil properties. This review explains the concept of cyber-agricultural systems (CAS) that integrates AI, advanced sensing, computational modeling, and scalable cyberinfrastructure to optimize soybean production, enhance resource management, reduce environmental impact, and improve farm efficiency. We explain the use of CAS in crop improvement as well. We provide an exhaustive listing of challenges and future direction in the integration of AI in soybean production and crop improvement, including multi-modal and layered sensing, data availability and quality, computational modeling, AI models and tools, Cyberinfrastructure, Explainability and interpretability of AI models, AI-related impacts on privacy, ethics, and policy, Impact on Smallholder Farmers, Digital Twin, Large Soybean Datasets for community usage, and Immersive environments.

AB  - Cognition, the set of mental processes that enable humans to perceive, reason, learn and decide, plays an essential role in effective collaboration between humans and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs). To achieve seamless cognitive interoperability between humans and CPSs, it is necessary to integrate a Cognitive Digital Twin (CDT) and a Human Digital Twin (HDT) to provide digital representations of both physical assets and human cognitive states. In this article, we first analyse the three essential functions of CDT and HDT: emulation, cognition and simulation, and review the state-of-the-art technologies for each of them, from supervised learning and knowledge graphs to deep reinforcement learning. Focusing on the cognitive layer, we review the state of the art in cognitive architectures, describing their symbolic, sub-symbolic and hybrid types and reporting on their real-world implementations in different domains. We then assess the relevance of these architectures for the integration of human-like reasoning in CDTs. Finally, we identify the main technological challenges and gaps that need to be addressed in order to implement fully operational CDTs.

AB  - The ever-increasing interest in and widespread diffusion of Machine Learning (ML)-based applications has driven a substantial amount of research into offensive and defensive ML. ML models can be attacked from different angles: poisoning attacks, the focus of this paper, inject maliciously crafted data points in the training set to modify the model behavior; adversarial attacks maliciously manipulate inference-time data points to fool the ML model and drive the prediction of the ML model according to the attacker’s objective. Ensemble-based techniques are among the most relevant defenses against poisoning attacks and replace the monolithic ML model with an ensemble of ML models trained on different (disjoint) subsets of the training set. They assign data points to the training sets of the models in the ensemble (routing) randomly or using a hash function, assuming that evenly distributing poisoned data points positively influences ML robustness. Our paper departs from this assumption and implements a risk-based ensemble technique where a risk management process is used to perform a smart routing of data points to the training sets. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of its soundness, robustness, and performance.

AB  - Analysing security in the architecture design of modern software systems is a challenging task. Emerging technologies utilised in building software systems may pose security threats, so software engineers need to consider both the structure and behaviour of architectural styles that employ these supporting technologies. This paper presents an automated approach to security analysis that helps to identify security characteristics at the architectural level. Key techniques used by our approach include the use of metrics, vulnerability identification and attack scenarios. Our modelling is expressive in defining architectural styles and security characteristics. Our analysis approach gives insightful results that allow software engineers to trace through the design to find parts of the system that may be impacted by attacks. We have developed an analysis tool that allows user to seamlessly model the software architecture design and analyse security. The evaluation has been conducted to assess the accuracy and performance of our approach. The results show that our analysis approach performs reasonably well to analyse the security in the architectural design.

KW  - Internet application classification
AB  - Recent years have seen substantial advancements in Internet technology along with environmental changes, which have led to the emergence of various security issues. There is also a trend of explosive growth in applications that encrypt network traffic for various types of services. Therefore, the classification of applications within encrypted traffic represents an important research issue for both secure network management and efficient bandwidth management. In such encrypted traffic, the payload itself is encrypted, and it is no longer viable to classify applications based on signatures extracted from plaintext. Most applications in public datasets for encrypted traffic classification are collected with the same IP address and port number, which makes the 5-tuple information a strong identifier. However, this 5-tuple contains many characteristics related to both the traffic collection environment and user-specific traits, rather than intrinsic features of the applications themselves. Therefore, when addressing the problem of encrypted traffic application classification, it is advisable to utilize header information excluding the 5-tuple and payload. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel service type and application classification system based on the Bidirectional Encoding Representation Transformer (BERT), which utilizes packet header information from encrypted traffic. The proposed system ensures the accuracy and generalization performance of the classification model by using only the header information from traffic packets, excluding the 5-tuple and payload. Further, to preserve the characteristics and semantic meaning of an encrypted traffic packet, sentences embedded with 2-byte tokens were used as input for BERT. The proposed system was designed to exclude labeling information from all sentences during the pre-training phase before proceeding with training. Fine-tuning was then conducted to align the system with the objectives of the service type and application classification. This experiment utilized the publicly available ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset, and the proposed model achieved remarkable accuracy in the key performance measure, i.e., F1-scores, with values of 99.24 % in service type classification and 98.74 % in application classification. This capability can be used in maintaining the confidentiality of encrypted traffic, network security monitoring, Quality of Service (QoS), and traffic management in complex IT environments.

AB  - In the context of consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the identification of vulnerabilities is becoming increasingly relevant. In this paper, we propose a scalable black-box assessment methodology for identifying authentication and reliability issues in IoT devices without the need for prior knowledge of device models or communication protocols. Our methodology consists of a suite of five black-box tests focusing on two specific aspects: authentication and reliability. One of these tests required the development of a tool, called REPLIOT, specifically aimed at discovering replay attacks on the local network. To the best of our knowledge, the development of such a tool is a significant contribution, as there was no similar tool previously available in the literature. We applied these tests to a testbed consisting of 51 consumer IoT devices. Our experiments reveal that 88% of the tested devices fail at least one of the proposed tests. Further manual investigation reveals severe implications of these results in terms of privacy, security, and reliability. Our findings underline a strong need to improve consumer IoT devices security practices to minimize these potential risks and protect smart home environments.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds transformative potential for supply chains, yet its adoption in emerging markets is hindered by systemic complexities and ethical-institutional tensions. This study employs system dynamics and causal loop diagrams to model the feedback mechanisms governing GenAI integration, focusing on technical, human, and institutional interdependencies. Through the identification of reinforcing loops and balancing loops, the research reveals how factors such as infrastructure readiness, stakeholder trust, and regulatory pressures dynamically interact to accelerate or constrain adoption. Findings highlight the dual role of feedback processes: while reinforcing loops drive efficiency gains and innovation, balancing loops introduce critical trade-offs, such as workforce skill erosion and data privacy risks. The study proposes actionable strategies for harmonizing scalability with ethical governance, emphasizing context-sensitive policies and hybrid human-AI decision frameworks. By bridging gaps in feedback-aware adoption models, this work offers a roadmap for sustainable GenAI integration in low-digital-maturity environments, balancing technological advancement with socio-ethical imperatives.

AB  - In recent years, memes have become a common medium of promulgating offensive views by the content polluters in social media. Due to their multimodal nature, memes can easily evade the content regulators’ eyes. The proliferation of these undesired or harmful memes can cause a detrimental impact on social harmony. Therefore, restraining offensive memes on social media is of utmost importance. However, analyzing memes is very complicated as they implicitly express human emotions. Previous studies have not explored the joint modelling of multimodal features and their counteractive unimodal features (i.e., image, text) to classify undesired memes. This paper presents a framework that utilizes the weighted ensemble technique to assign weights to the participating visual, textual and multimodal models. The state-of-the-art visual (i.e., VGG19, VGG16, ResNet50) and textual (i.e., multilingual-BERT, multilingual-DistilBERT, XLM-R) models are employed to make the constituent modules of the framework. Moreover, two fusion approaches (i.e., early fusion and late fusion) are used to combine the visual and textual features for developing the multimodal models. The evaluations have demonstrated that the proposed weighted ensemble technique improves the performance over the investigated unimodal, multimodal, and ensemble models. The result shows that the proposed approach achieves superior outcomes on two multilingual benchmark datasets (MultiOFF and TamilMemes), with 66.73% and 58.59% weighted f1-scores, respectively. Furthermore, the comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach outdoes other existing works by improving approximately 13% and 2% weighted f1-score gain.

AB  - The fake news phenomenon has a significant impact on societies, homeland security, democracy and the functioning of the public space. The spread of false information is becoming an increasing challenge in the context of the dynamic growth of the volume of content shared by news outlets and social media. The overwhelming amount of this information makes manual verification of every news item or press release practically impossible. The current development of technology in the field of natural language processing (NLP) opens up new possibilities for the development of automatic content verification systems. The automation of this process not only improves but also significantly speeds up the detection of unreliable information, which is a key tool in the fight against fake news. In this article, we propose an innovative approach that involves a multi-factor assessment of the content of documents, as opposed to the frequently used approach of binary classification into fake and non-fake. Our classification system is based on analysis using graph neural networks, which allows for a more complex and contextual understanding of the data. The obtained results indicate a significant improvement in effectiveness compared to the baseline approaches, which suggests a potential for enhanced mitigation of misinformation dissemination.

AB  - The global challenges of the 21st century, including climate change, the digital divide, social inequalities, and poverty, pose significant obstacles to sustainable development, as highlighted by the United Nations agenda. Its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outline a vision for addressing these issues, necessitating innovative solutions powered by infrastructures such as 6G, a key driver of high-performance networking and societal progress. Achieving this dual objective requires a value-driven approach that extends beyond traditional communication network functionalities. In this context, Key Value Indicators (KVIs) emerge as essential metrics that capture intangible yet critical societal values, complementing traditional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, the integration of ethical principles and social values into networking remains largely unexplored in the scientific literature and research communities. Building on these premises, this work introduces a system design framework that formalizes and evaluates KVIs alongside KPIs, leveraging Intent-Based Networking (IBN) to embed ethical and social dimensions into network services. To enable responsible resource-service provisioning, a bi-objective optimization problem is formulated, balancing network performance and societal value. The problem is solved using an exact ɛ-constraint method, ensuring optimal trade-offs between KPIs and KVIs. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed service orchestration framework, demonstrating an improvement of up to 70% in the ethical and social value provided by the network compared to baseline solutions. This highlights the framework’s capability to integrate social and ethical considerations into the service allocation process while preserving competitive network performance.

The proliferation of online advertising technologies further exacerbates privacy concerns by exploiting user data for marketing or surveillance, frequently without explicit consent. It is crucial to regularly ensure the latest features of default configurations, which are most relevant for novice users, adequately address growing privacy demands given the centrality of web browsers to internet usage. Our work scrutinizes the privacy claims of 14 desktop browsers and their default configurations, from mainstream options like Chrome to those prioritizing privacy, such as Brave. We validate these claims through a suite of privacy tests on two operating systems commonly used by cyber novices. Based on our findings, we categorize browsers into three tiers of privacy protection. We conclude by outlining future browser design principles and offering privacy-centric recommendations tailored for novice users.

AB  - This paper presents a real-time online recruitment application that integrates semantic similarity and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve job-candidate matching. It addresses the growing volume of job applications and the limitations of traditional keyword-based systems, which often fail to capture contextual meaning and complex semantic relationships in job-candidate alignment. The proposed system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity scoring, and domain-specific keyword weighting, to interpret conceptual relevance between resumes and job descriptions, enabling more accurate and inclusive recruitment outcomes. This research developed the system in Python and evaluated it using simulated and real-world recruitment datasets. Experimental results show that the semantic model consistently outperforms keyword-based matching across diverse job domains. For instance, in simulated tests, similarity scores reached 0.74 in the Software Engineer domain, compared to just 0.35 using keyword-based methods. Real-world evaluations further confirmed the model’s effectiveness, with semantic scores of 0.83, 0.76, and 0.74 for the Hadoop, Data Science, and PMP domains, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding keyword-based scores remained below 0.17. Additionally, the system performs well in aligning generalist and specialist profiles, achieving a score of 0.88 for Data analysis roles. These findings validate the system’s robustness, scalability, and ability to interpret varied terminology across job sectors. The research presents a scalable, AI-driven framework that supports context-aware, fair, and accurate job matching, significantly advancing intelligent recruitment technology.

AB  - Introduction
In 2025, the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) will turn 50 years old. Every one of the BWC’s 189 States Parties will decide whether to give the treaty its first real upgrade and make it future-proof.
Objective
The biothreat posed by state and non-state actors has evolved with the democratization of synthetic biology and genetic engineering including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and gain-of-function research, artificial intelligence (AI), and 3D bioprinting. Combined with algorithms applied to genomic databases, these technologies have revolutionized biological agent modification and the delivery or dissemination vectors for the biological weapon system in line with potential biowarfare objectives. Infections, outbreak-scale disasters, or large-scale health security incident scenarios are forecasted and explored by AI using global and parallel genomic databases that feed AI prediction outcomes.
Methods
The traditional definition rooted in the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 primarily focused on microorganisms, toxins, and their means of delivery intended for hostile purposes, Article I. However, biotechnology’s rapid advancement and diffusion have blurred the lines between defensive and offensive research, creating opportunities for both state and non-state actors to develop and deploy novel bioweapons.
Results
This paper contends that a contemporary definition of biological weapons must encompass any biological agent, technology, or knowledge with the potential to cause harm to humans, animals, or the environment when used for malicious purposes. Such a definition acknowledges the dual-use dilemma inherent in biotechnological advancements. To address these evolving threats, this paper proposes a multifaceted approach centered on strengthening international norms, fostering responsible innovation, and enhancing global collaboration and a reevaluation of the definition of biological weapons and the international frameworks designed to prevent their misuse and the lessons from the historical progress of bioweapons and bioterrorism from ancient times to the present has been studied in terms of developments in the technology and understanding of the Biothreat processes.
Conclusion
The redefinition of biological weapons considering technical advances from different regions' committees is not purely an academic or public health exercise but an urgent imperative for defending global health and security as Framework of New Definition of Biological Weapon Map of the proposed new definition of Biological Weapon links new modern technology AI with genome database of Humans, Animals, Plant, Pathogen, environmental health, and Climate Change come in one body under combines multiple international, governmental, non-governmental organizations and, Interpol is the common challenge among those sectors Biosafety, Biosecurity, Bioethics and Cybersecurity linked with Law and Culture.

AB  - Stance detection identifies a person’s evaluation of a subject, and is a crucial component for many downstream applications. In application, stance detection requires training a machine learning model on an annotated dataset and applying the model on another to predict stances of text snippets. This cross-dataset model generalization poses three central questions, which we investigate using stance classification models on 7 publicly available English Twitter datasets ranging from 297 to 48,284 instances. (1) Are stance classification models generalizable across datasets? We construct a single dataset model to train/test dataset-against-dataset, finding models do not generalize well (avg F1=0.33). (2) Can we improve the generalizability by aggregating datasets? We find a multi dataset model built on the aggregation of datasets has an improved performance (avg F1=0.69). (3) Given a model built on multiple datasets, how much additional data is required to fine-tune it? We find it challenging to ascertain a minimum number of data points due to the lack of pattern in performance. Investigating possible reasons for the choppy model performance we find that texts are not easily differentiable by stances, nor are annotations consistent within and across datasets. Our observations emphasize the need for an aggregated dataset as well as consistent labels for the generalizability of models.

AB  - Organized social robot accounts can launch Sybil attacks on online social networks (OSNs) for various malicious purposes, thus significantly affecting the user experience of online communities and damaging the reputation of OSNs. Therefore, detecting Sybil accounts in OSNs is crucial in cyberspace governance. Among the existing Sybil account detection methods, structure-based methods appear to be the most promising because of their ability to model the states and behaviors of social network accounts effectively. However, most of these structure-based methods only model the social accounts in OSNs while ignoring the content generated in OSNs, such as tweets of Twitter accounts. To address this deficiency, this study proposes an efficient model called SybilFlyover, which uses a heterogeneous graph-based method to represent all types of entities existing in an OSN uniformly, as well as complex relationships between the entities in a directed heterogeneous social network graph. During the modeling process, content-based social network information is injected into the model using a method based on prompt learning to achieve more accurate modeling of the real state of an OSN. Finally, the social network graph was processed using a transformer-based method to identify nodes representing Sybil accounts. The results of an experiment on a real public dataset demonstrate that the proposed SybilFlyover model outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline models in Sybil account detection.

AB  - Healthcare organizations have realized that Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a competitive edge through personalized patient experiences, improved patient outcomes, early diagnosis, augmented clinician capabilities, enhanced operational efficiencies, or improved medical service accessibility. However, deploying AI-driven tools in the healthcare ecosystem could be challenging. This paper categorizes AI applications in healthcare and comprehensively examines the challenges associated with deploying AI in medical practices at scale. As AI continues to make strides in healthcare, its integration presents various challenges, including production timelines, trust generation, privacy concerns, algorithmic biases, and data scarcity. The paper highlights that flawed business models and wrong workflows in healthcare practices cannot be rectified merely by deploying AI-driven tools. Healthcare organizations should re-evaluate root problems such as misaligned financial incentives (e.g., fee-for-service models), dysfunctional medical workflows (e.g., high rates of patient readmissions), poor care coordination between different providers, fragmented electronic health records systems, and inadequate patient education and engagement models in tandem with AI adoption. This study also explores the need for a cultural shift in viewing AI not as a threat but as an enabler that can enhance healthcare delivery and create new employment opportunities while emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying operational issues. The necessity of investments beyond finance is discussed, emphasizing the importance of human capital, continuous learning, and a supportive environment for AI integration. The paper also highlights the crucial role of clear regulations in building trust, ensuring safety, and guiding the ethical use of AI, calling for coherent frameworks addressing transparency, model accuracy, data quality control, liability, and ethics. Furthermore, this paper underscores the importance of advancing AI literacy within academia to prepare future healthcare professionals for an AI-driven landscape. Through careful navigation and proactive measures addressing these challenges, the healthcare community can harness AI's transformative power responsibly and effectively, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and patient care. The paper concludes with a vision and strategic suggestions for the future of healthcare with AI, emphasizing thoughtful, responsible, and innovative engagement as the pathway to realizing its full potential to unlock immense benefits for healthcare organizations, physicians, nurses, and patients while proactively mitigating risks.

AB  - The development of Green and Digital Shipping Corridors (GDSCs) represents a significant advancement in promoting sustainable and efficient maritime transport. However, as these corridors evolve, they also introduce emerging and complex security challenges for ports. The integration of advanced digital and intelligent technologies, alongside the adoption of alternative fuels and renewable energy systems, increases vulnerabilities in port operations. While foundational international and regional frameworks have laid an initial groundwork for port security, critical gaps remain. Using a combination of legal and policy analysis approach, this study critically examines these institutional shortcomings in addressing emerging security risks at ports associated with GDSC development, including insufficient integration of emerging security risks into regulatory frameworks, inadequate governmental participation in international regulation, deficiencies in private sector safety governance, unclear accountability, and limited technical standard coordination and security training. This study highlights the need for strengthened port security cooperative governance to address these emerging challenges within the context of GDSC development under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

KW  - Social media
AB  - The struggle of social media platforms to moderate content in a timely manner, encourages users to abuse such platforms to spread vulgar or abusive language, which, when performed repeatedly becomes cyberbullying — a social problem taking place in virtual environments, yet with real-world consequences, such as depression, withdrawal, or even suicide attempts of its victims. Systems for the automatic detection and mitigation of cyberbullying have been developed but, unfortunately, the vast majority of them are for the English language, with only a handful available for low-resource languages. To estimate the present state of research and recognize the needs for further development, in this paper we present a comprehensive systematic survey of studies done so far for automatic cyberbullying detection in low-resource languages. We analyzed all studies on this topic that were available.We investigated more than seventy published studies on automatic detection of cyberbullying or related language in low-resource languages and dialects that were published between around 2017 and January 2023. There are 23 low-resource languages and dialects covered by this paper, including Bangla, Hindi, Dravidian languages and others. In the survey, we identify some of the research gaps of previous studies, which include the lack of reliable definitions of cyberbullying and its relevant subcategories, biases in the acquisition, and annotation of data. Based on recognizing those research gaps, we provide some suggestions for improving the general research conduct in cyberbullying detection, with a primary focus on low-resource languages. Based on those proposed suggestions, we collect and release a cyberbullying dataset in the Chittagonian dialect of Bangla and propose a number of initial ML solutions trained on that dataset. In addition, pre-trained transformer-based the BanglaBERT model was also attempted. We conclude with additional discussions on ethical issues regarding such studies, highlight how our survey improves on similar surveys done in the past, and discuss the usefulness of recently popular AI-enhanced tools for streamlining such scientific surveys.

AB  - The proliferation of malware has exhibited a substantial surge in both quantity and diversity, posing significant threats to the Internet and indispensable network applications. The accurate and effective classification makes a pivotal role in defending against malware. Numerous approaches employ supervised learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to train feature extractors. However, acquiring a substantial quantity of labeled samples incurs significant expenses, and relying solely on CNNs as feature extractors may result in restricted local receptive fields, consequently compromising the preservation of crucial features. In order to address these constraints, we propose an effective malware classification approach, denoted as MalSort, which leverages the masked self-supervised framework with Swin Transformer. Initially, each instance of malware is transformed into a color image. Furthermore, the Swin Transformer self-supervised framework is utilized to extract multi-scale key feature vectors from a randomly masked partial color image, while the prediction module is employed to predict the masked image. Ultimately, the pre-trained encoder is fine-tuned using the malware dataset to effectively carry out a malware classification task. Our MalSort exhibits a reduced reliance on labeled data samples during the training phase, thereby obviating the necessity for extensive amounts of labeled data. Consequently, the MalSort conserves hardware resources and improve its training efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the MalSort outperforms existing models by achieving a classification accuracy of 97.85%, a recall of 97.63%, a precision of 97.85%, and an F1-score of 97.85% on the BIG2015 dataset. Similarly, on the Malimg dataset, the model achieves percentages of 98.28%, 98.18%, 98.19%, and 98.28% for classification accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, respectively.

While previous research has acknowledged both the benefits and challenges of AI, the rapid development of GAI has often proceeded without sufficient focus on actionable strategies to address potential risks and unintended consequences. Understanding both the positive and negative aspects of GAI is essential to ensure that technological progress is balanced and responsibly managed to mitigate potential risks and societal harm. This study identifies the positive and negative aspects of GAI from both public and expert viewpoints by applying a valence framework. Using a mixed-methods approach that integrates joint sentiment topic (JST) modeling with the combined use of ChatGPT and expert interviews, we investigated the key positive and negative factors associated with GAI. By integrating the insights gained from these different perspectives, the study proposes strategies for the effective and responsible use of GAI. The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge on GAI by offering a comprehensive understanding of its implications and providing guidance for its ethical and appropriate applications.

AB  - Malicious traffic detection over the internet is one of the challenging areas for researchers to protect network infrastructures from any malicious activity. Several shortcomings of a network system can be leveraged by an attacker to get unauthorized access through malicious traffic. Safeguard from such attacks requires an efficient automatic system that can detect malicious traffic timely and avoid system damage. Currently, many automated systems can detect malicious activity, however, the efficacy and accuracy need further improvement to detect malicious traffic from multi-domain systems. The present study focuses on the detection of malicious traffic with high accuracy using machine learning techniques. The proposed approach used two datasets UNSW-NB15 and IoTID20 which contain the data for IoT-based traffic and local network traffic, respectively. Both datasets were combined to increase the capability of the proposed approach in detecting malicious traffic from local and IoT networks, with high accuracy. Horizontally merging both datasets requires an equal number of features which was achieved by reducing feature count to 30 for each dataset by leveraging principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed model incorporates stacked ensemble model extra boosting forest (EBF) which is a combination of tree-based models such as extra tree classifier, gradient boosting classifier, and random forest using a stacked ensemble approach. Empirical results show that EBF performed significantly better and achieved the highest accuracy score of 0.985 and 0.984 on the multi-domain dataset for two and four classes, respectively.

AB  - Purpose
Phishing is a serious cybersecurity problem, which is widely available through multimedia, such as e-mail and Short Messaging Service (SMS) to collect the personal information of the individual. However, the rapid growth of the unsolicited and unwanted information needs to be addressed, raising the necessity of the technology to develop any effective anti-phishing methods.
Design/methodology/approach
The primary intention of this research is to design and develop an approach for preventing phishing by proposing an optimization algorithm. The proposed approach involves four steps, namely preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection and classification, for dealing with phishing e-mails. Initially, the input data set is subjected to the preprocessing, which removes stop words and stemming in the data and the preprocessed output is given to the feature extraction process. By extracting keyword frequency from the preprocessed, the important words are selected as the features. Then, the feature selection process is carried out using the Bhattacharya distance such that only the significant features that can aid the classification are selected. Using the selected features, the classification is done using the deep belief network (DBN) that is trained using the proposed fractional-earthworm optimization algorithm (EWA). The proposed fractional-EWA is designed by the integration of EWA and fractional calculus to determine the weights in the DBN optimally.
Findings
The accuracy of the methods, naive Bayes (NB), DBN, neural network (NN), EWA-DBN and fractional EWA-DBN is 0.5333, 0.5455, 0.5556, 0.5714 and 0.8571, respectively. The sensitivity of the methods, NB, DBN, NN, EWA-DBN and fractional EWA-DBN is 0.4558, 0.5631, 0.7035, 0.7045 and 0.8182, respectively. Likewise, the specificity of the methods, NB, DBN, NN, EWA-DBN and fractional EWA-DBN is 0.5052, 0.5631, 0.7028, 0.7040 and 0.8800, respectively. It is clear from the comparative table that the proposed method acquired the maximal accuracy, sensitivity and specificity compared with the existing methods.
Originality/value
The e-mail phishing detection is performed in this paper using the optimization-based deep learning networks. The e-mails include a number of unwanted messages that are to be detected in order to avoid the storage issues. The importance of the method is that the inclusion of the historical data in the detection process enhances the accuracy of detection.

AB  - With the rapid evolution and proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) throughout the past decade, industry-wide Deep Learning (DL) applications within IIoT ecosystems are expected to rise exponentially within this coming decade. However, recent studies have highlighted the extreme sensitivity and vulnerability of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples. While being imperceptible and benign to the naked human eye, those adversarial perturbations crafted from one-pixel attacks can drastically impact the accuracy of DNNs. The consequences of those adversarial attacks in critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles can prove disastrous. Therefore, the urge to ensure the robustness and resilience of DL systems against one-pixel attacks has recently started attracting stupendous attention from both academicians and industry professionals. Throughout this paper, we first develop a one-pixel threat model within an IIoT ecosystem and propose a novel image recovery defense mechanism to detect and mitigate one-pixel attacks based on Accelerated Proximal Gradient approach. Experimental results proved that our proposed solution is highly effective and efficient in detecting and mitigating one-pixel attacks in state-of-the-art neural networks, more specifically LeNet and ResNet, using the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets.

AB  - Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations—defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites—and represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4–11 % performance improvement over other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse likelihood as actionable risk scores. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/jaehanwork/PassREfinder-FL.

AB  - The increasing usage of social media networks has raised concerns about the growing frequency of cyberbullying incidents. The definition of cyberbullying lacks universal consensus, yet according to several authors, cyberbullying is characterized by aggressive, repetitive, and intentional communication among peers. However, existing cyberbullying detection datasets often focus solely on classifying texts as aggressive or non-aggressive, neglecting the other cyberbullying aspects, thus hindering research progress. This paper proposes a framework for designing a new dataset incorporating all four aspects of cyberbullying to address this gap. The text messages are sourced from a real dataset, while the users’ data is generated synthetically. The resulting dataset contains messages exchanged randomly among different pairs of users, thus inculcating repetition. Additionally, the degree of peerness, defined and calculated to measure the likelihood of two users being peers, is used. The intent of harm is quantified as a numeric value using the ratios of aggression and repetition. As a result, the proposed dataset encompasses all four aspects of cyberbullying by providing repeated aggressive messages among users along with quantitative values of the degree of peerness and intent to harm. The proposed dataset is adaptable, with adjustable threshold values for peerness, repetition, and intent to harm, offering flexibility for various applications. The paper concludes by presenting the results of some baseline machine-learning methods on the proposed dataset.

KW  - Pipeline model

KW  - Reinforced K-means
AB  - Network attack behavior is always mixed with a large number of normal communications, which makes the attack characteristics only account for a very small fraction in the log data. From the perspective of simulation and modeling, the data for attack detection is extremely unbalanced if we regard the attack behavior as the positive label. Network instruction detection is an important topic in identifying the attack behavior, but the detection methods based on simulation and model, such as traditional machine learning, face the challenges of poor effectiveness and efficiency. Supervised models, such as LightGBM, can effectively classify abnormal data because of the fast training speed and its high efficiency. However, it works badly when dealing with sparse negative data, such as the network intrusion data. On the other hand, unsupervised models, such as K-means, can achieve good performance with undesirable training time cost. However, it is difficult to select an appropriate parameter for network intrusion. In this paper, we propose a two-stage pipeline model named STG2P, which leverages the improved LightGBM and the reinforced K-means. Specifically, STG2P introduces a threshold for LightGBM in the coarse classification stage, and pipelines the draft results to K-means for filtering the false positive samples in the fine classification stage. By adaptively adopting the pipelined data of the improved LightGBM and K-means, the method can avoid the shortcomings of both models. We also conduct extensive simulations on the LANL dataset, and the results show that the AUC value can be improved as high as 29.48%. The detection rate of our method can reach 96.64%, which shows superior performance compared with some traditional detection methods.

AB  - Smart manufacturing, also known as Industry 4.0, is a manufacturing paradigm that aims to realize autonomous processes, minimizing human involvement. In the advent of manufacturing-unfriendly situations (e.g., pandemics), it has been learned that the paradigm does not work correctly and has limitations in handling those situations. There is a consensus that humans still play a crucial role in manufacturing, and the ultimate goal of manufacturing is to benefit them. To align with this, the European Commission introduced Industry 5.0, targeting human centricity, sustainability, and resilience. Operator 5.0 has also been presented to improve the physical and cognitive capabilities of shop operators. In contrast, the new concept of human-in-the-loop in smart manufacturing (H-SM), aiming for the involvement of diverse stakeholders, has been recently proposed. In this paper, we introduce the research methodology to elaborate on the current application fields of the H-SM concept. For this, we revisit the existing paradigms and their case studies. Also, we categorize them in terms of different components in H-SM and with respect to different levels of physical and cognitive capabilities and experiences. Then, we identify seven technology clusters and twenty-one key-enabling technologies for the H-SM implementation. It can be concluded the H-SM is well-aligned with human-intervened autonomous manufacturing.

AB  - With the rapid development of advanced enabling technologies such as cloud computing, large language models, big data, and digital twin (DT), smart assembly has emerged as a central focus within smart manufacturing research. Robots, serving as indispensable execution units in this domain, have traditionally been implemented in serial or rigid parallel configurations. However, these robots typically encounter challenges such as limited load capacity, insufficient rigidity, and complex singularities. Although DT technology has been increasingly applied to robot modeling and simulation, current research falls short in addressing coordinating dynamic assembly processes and ensuring digital-physical synchronization. This gap fails to fully meet the demands of complex assembly tasks. To address these challenges, this study investigates cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) with a large workspace, high load capacity, and strong dynamic performance. A DT-based smart assembly application framework for CDPRs is proposed, and four key technologies are explored in depth: (1) cable-driven parallel robots assembly process digital twin (CAPDT) model construction; (2) task-level assembly planning; (3) adaptive assembly instruction generation; and (4) CAPDT model consistency retention. These technologies collectively support assembly task planning, simulation verification, performance control, and process management. Finally, a simplified satellite assembly task is presented as a case study, and a DT-based CDPR assembly prototype system for is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed application framework and technologies.

AB  - One of the negative aspects of the world becoming more digitized has been fake news, i.e., online disinformation – false, often fabricated reports of events, written and read on websites. The term has already entered collective consciousness and become an inseparable element of scientific discourse. Once a piece of news goes online, stopping it from spreading may become a complicated matter. Literature suggests that the two main pillars of the effective fight against fake news are education and detection. Thus, this paper describes a multidisciplinary study performed by a group of scientists representing two distinct fields - AI and linguistics. In their joint study, they compared, formally evaluated and explored the intersection between two approaches to fake news detection, i.e., the automated one, using a machine-learning-based tool, and the linguistic-based human judgement, using the data from two disinformation campaigns, sourced from two open benchmark fake news datasets. The study focused on the news' headlines as an effective proxy for the identification of fake news. In accordance with the achieved results, the paper argues that in the fight against fake news, the two approaches have the potential of augmenting and enhancing each other, utilizing the state-of-the-art technologies and linguistic knowledge. In addition, this paper provides a list of the linguistic features characteristic of possible disinformation, which is the most comprehensive collection of this kind in the subject literature to date.

AB  - To detect new malware, machine learning approaches require many training samples. These training samples contribute to build an accurate model. To maintain the accuracy, collecting comprehensive samples continuously is very important. However, new malicious samples appear one after another, and thereby making it difficult. Hence, actual small training samples do not likely to represent the entire population adequately. Despite this gap between ideal and reality, few studies have addressed this practical problem in macro malware. To enhance small training samples, data augmentation is efficient in the field of image recognition. Data augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a reasonable approach for oversampling the minority class. A major difficulty of GANs is to generate fake samples that represent the context. This paper attempts to generate fake text vectors with Paragraph Vector to enhance small training samples. Paragraph Vector is a model to convert text into vectors, which represents the context and numerical distance. These features allow to directly vary each element of the vectors. Our method adds random noise to the vectors to generate fake text vectors which represent the context. This paper applies this technique to detect new malicious VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros to address the practical problem. This generic technique could be used for not only malware detection, but also any imbalanced and contextual data. To simulate small training samples, we reduce the malicious samples, and generate fake samples from the reduced ones. The experimental result shows that the fake samples enhance our model, and improve the detection rate.

AB  - Chatbots represent a promising approach to provide instructional content and facilitate active learning processes. However, there is a lack of knowledge as how to design chatbot interactions for active learning. In response to this knowledge gap, we conducted an experimental study (n = 164) comparing four modes for providing instructional content in chatbots, with varying demands for cognitive engagement. The four modes – passive, active, constructive, and interactive – were based on the ICAP framework of active learning. The learning content concerned identification of phishing emails and the four modes were distinguished by how the participants were invited to engage with the content during their chatbot interaction. The ICAP modes of higher cognitive engagement required participants to spend more time on the interaction and led to perceptions of higher subjective learning outcome. However, the effects of the different ICAP modes were not found to be significantly different in terms of user engagement, social presence, intention to use, or objective learning outcomes. The study represents an important first step towards understanding the design of chatbots for active learning.

AB  - Technological advancements have fostered ubiquitous connectivity, driving the adoption of cloud computing and cloud-based services and applications for maintenance and management purposes. Consequently, cloud computing and cloud-based services have gained popularity for their scalability and efficiency in maintenance and management. However, such interconnected systems are inherently vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and others. Blockchain technology, initially popularized through cryptocurrencies, has proven to be a robust and reliable solution for various applications beyond financial transactions, such as supply chain management and secure data sharing. The integration of blockchain with cloud computing has given rise to the concept of “Blockchain as a Service” (BaaS), which provides developers with scalable and ready-to-use blockchain frameworks without the need for backend management. The current blockchain network has limitations such as low transaction per second (TPS), prolonged mining times, and other challenges that make it difficult for certain service-oriented applications. To address these issues, this paper introduces a hybrid on-off chain, edge-enabled BaaS solution called Pure Chain for service computing. Pure Chain refines the consensus algorithm, enhances the mining process, and enables seamless edge-supported online-offline hybrid transactions. Moreover, modified blockchain layers to improve efficiency and scalability. Pure Chain facilitates blockchain-enabled services and smart contract deployment in a cloud computing environment. Pure Chain optimizes energy consumption and delivers transaction speeds that are 12 times faster than conventional blockchain networks.

AB  - Communication in society had developed within cultural and geographical boundaries prior to the invention of digital technology. The latest advancements in communication technology have significantly surpassed the conventional constraints for communication with regards to time and location. These new platforms have ushered in a new age of user-generated content, online chats, social network and comprehensive data on individual behavior. However, the abuse of communication software such as social media websites, online communities, and chats has resulted in a new kind of online hostility and aggressive actions. Due to widespread use of the social networking platforms and technological gadgets, conventional bullying has migrated from physical form to online, where it is termed as Cyberbullying. However, recently the digital technologies as machine learning and deep learning have been showing their efficiency in identifying linguistic patterns used by cyberbullies and cyberbullying detection problem. In this research paper, we aimed to evaluate shallow machine learning and deep learning methods in cyberbullying detection problem. We deployed three deep and six shallow learning algorithms for cyberbullying detection problems. The results show that bidirectional long-short-term memory is the most efficient method for cyberbullying detection, in terms of accuracy and recall.

AB  - In an increasingly digital world, collecting, processing, and exchanging personal data are critical drivers for enacting enterprise business processes. However, the long-term retention and access of personal data expose organizations to data breaches, in which sensitive and protected data are disclosed and exploited unauthorizedly. To mitigate the damage that data breaches can cause, in the European Union (EU), the right to data privacy is enforced through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which defines how organizations must store and manage EU citizens’ data. GDPR is highly influencing how organizations approach data privacy, forcing them to rethink and upgrade their business processes to become GDPR compliant, which can be daunting. In this paper, in line with the privacy-by-design principles of GDPR, we propose a methodology that shows how to capture the main privacy GDPR constraints in the form of design patterns and integrate them into business process models specified in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). This allows us to achieve full transparency of privacy constraints in business processes, making it possible to ensure their compliance with GDPR at design-time. We adopt a design science research approach to present our methodology and make design decisions explicit. We also introduce GDPR-Pilot, a BPMN editor that assists process designers and Data Controllers in integrating GDPR patterns into existing models. The methodology is evaluated through real-world use cases against structural, usage, and environmental requirements.

AB  - Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to AI systems, yet existing detection methods mainly focus on image-level threats, limiting fine-grained localization of perturbations. To address this challenge, we propose AttackTracer, the first semantic-level localization framework specifically designed for instance-level adversarial attacks. Instance-level adversarial perturbations are typically sparse and localized, which aligns naturally with the capabilities of diffusion models to progressively reconstruct sparse structures from stochastic noise. Building on this property, AttackTracer models the adversarial mask as a conditional distribution given the adversarial image, allowing iterative refinement and effective recovery of attack regions. To address the inherent instability of diffusion sampling, we introduce the Temporal Evidence Fusion Strategy (TEFS). TEFS integrates Dempster–Shafer theory with a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)-guided temporal ensemble, aggregating multi-step predictions to mitigate conflicts and uncertainty, thus achieving robust inference. Furthermore, adversarial perturbations often manifest as subtle high-frequency and edge distortions. To capture these, AttackTracer employs two complementary modules: the Wavelet Frequency Fusion Block (WFFB), which extracts multi-scale frequency features via Discrete Wavelet Transform to enhance sensitivity to sparse perturbations, and the Edge Feature Enhancement Module (EFEM), which models multi-granularity edge structures using parallel branches and FFT to detect boundary distortions. Together, WFFB and EFEM provide complementary views of perturbation patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AttackTracer achieves superior traceability of adversarial regions while maintaining robustness across stochastic sampling and varying scales, highlighting its effectiveness for instance-level attack localization.

AB  - JavaScript has played a crucial role in web development, making it a primary tool for hackers to launch assaults. Although malicious JavaScript detection methods are becoming increasingly effective, the existing methods based on feature matching or static word embeddings are difficult to detect different versions and obfuscation of JavaScript code. To solve this problem, we present JSContana, a novel detection method that consists of adaptable context analysis and efficient key feature extraction. The key to our approach is context analysis based on dynamic word embeddings. We convert JavaScript code to syntax unit sequences with detailed information and get the real contextual representation of code by dynamic word embeddings. Furthermore, as a classification module in the method, TextCNN can effectively extract key features. To demonstrate the performance of the method, we have conducted extensive comparison experiments under five-fold cross-validation. Numerical results show that the method achieves 0.990 in AUC-score, and outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to 3.5%.

AB  - Hackers increasingly tend to abuse and nefariously use cloud services by injecting malicious mining code. This malicious code can be spread through infrastructures in the cloud platforms and pose a great threat to users and enterprises. In this study, a method is proposed for detecting malicious mining code in the cloud platforms, which constructs a detection model by fusing the Bagging and Boosting algorithms. By randomly extracting samples and letting models vote together to decide, the variance of model detection can be reduced obviously. Compared with traditional classifiers, the proposed method can obtain higher accuracy and better robustness. The experimental results show that, for the given dataset, the values of AUC and F1-score can reach 0.992 and 0.987 respectively, and the standard deviation of AUC values under different data inputs is only 0.0009.

AB  - The development of data-driven building applications is hindered by the extensive manual effort required to preprocess building metadata. This preprocessing is critical for translating the raw, building-specific metadata of physical entities (e.g., chillers, AHUs) into a standardized schema (e.g., Brick) that applications can interpret. The diversity of building metadata conventions across buildings makes automation difficult, creating a significant bottleneck. In this paper, we formalize the automation of building metadata generation as a text analysis problem and address it through information extraction, a paradigm to systematically transform unstructured metadata into structured representations. We define three distinct problem variants to encompass key application scenarios. Our analysis of real-world metadata reveals unique technical challenges, including corpus denoising, coreference resolution, and disambiguation. To overcome these, we present MetaCloze, a novel system that implements tailored solutions for each challenge. Evaluated across six real buildings, MetaCloze achieves a state-of-the-art strict accuracy of 97.5 % in automated entity recognition and relation extraction, demonstrating its potential to eliminate a major barrier in smart building application development.
